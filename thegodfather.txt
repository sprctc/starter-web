I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.
Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment.
Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful?
My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.

My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.
We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family.
It's not personal. It's business.
Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.
I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over!
