I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.
Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment.
Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful?
My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.

My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.
We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family.
It's not personal. It's business.
Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.
I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over!

Is that why you slapped my brother around in public?
In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.
What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born?
Te salut, Don Corleone.
Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense.
Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry.
Do me this favor. I won't forget it.
Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you.
Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening?
